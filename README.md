* Have original array of
                wicket keepers
                batsmens
                bowlers
                allrounders
  These arrays will remain source of truth.
  These arrays can not be edited or changed.

* Now duplicate the original arrays which will be used to shuffle and bring predicted teams
                shuffled array will contain atleast 1 player from array of wicket keeper, batsmen , bowler and all rounder
                duplicate arrays will be removed of 1 player which are in shuffled array
                remaining duplicate array items will be merged into single array so that which can be used to generate remaing player ( shuffle algo work on this elements )
                shuffled array will be generated finally
